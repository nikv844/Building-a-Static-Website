Creating Text Content with HTML

Find an article from the web (For example: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology).

Create an empty HTML page and save it.

Use the text from the article you picked. Donâ€™t care about the visualization (like fonts, color etc.) or other page elements in the web page (like navigation, sidebar, ads...). The main thing is that you copy the text, markup the headings, paragraphs and so on from the article.

For example

1. Markup the title as heading 1. All the other headings are probably heading 2 or 3.

2. Text is inside p elements.

3. Add an image.

4. If there is an lead (ingressi in Finnish) of such, you can mark it like: <p class="lead">Loren ipsum</p>

5. If there are quotations, use i or blockquote tags.

6. Do you need to make some text bolder?

7. If there are no links in the text, make at least one link.

8. You can markup the date and possible author like this: <p class="date">12.5.2019</p> or <span class="date">12.5.2019</span>
